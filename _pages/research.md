My research is multidisciplinary, and it involves the areas of machine learning, signal processing, healthcare, dynamic systems, control theory, health informatics, and renewable energy. My primary goal is to develop novel mathematical models and machine learning algorithms to solve problems with practical impact.



To this end, my work has spanned diverse aspects of model/data-driven method development as well as applications with emphasis on optimization algorithms and applications on a different paradigm. 



From an algorithmic standpoint, I designed novel machine learning  and control algorithms grounded on theoretical foundations. On the application perspective, I devised optimization framework for problems in different regimes. Specifically, my work is  delineated as follows:
